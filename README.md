# Maisha Meds Data Engineering assessment

At Maisha Meds we often work with universities and research institutions who are interested in conducting studies using our data. 

The researchers are interested in knowing about how many of each of the following products have been sold in each of these countries over the past year, the average price, and some information about sale dates. Only facilities from cities that contain more than 3 facilities should be included for data privacy reasons. 

The final table should have the following columns:

| Country | Product Name | Total Sold | Average Price | First Sale | Most Recent Sale |
|---------|--------------|------------|---------------|------------|------------------|
